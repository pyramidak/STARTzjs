In the START menu, you can launch multiple applications at once, set up auto-launch, run as administrator, assign HotKeys, search for not found, and even uninstall the program.

TAPs is not just a type of task manager to download a file to put the computer to sleep or to start/close an application or send an email in time. Thanks to MQTT communication, it connects to smart devices or Home Assistant. Then you can turn off the sound when someone calls. Switch the image output to the projector when it is on. Pause the video when you leave the room. 

You also get a Calculator where you can write the examples directly.
